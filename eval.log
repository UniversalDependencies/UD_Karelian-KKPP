[Line 161 Sent vepkar-1774.7 Node 15]: [L3 Syntax too-many-subjects] Node has multiple subjects not subtyped as ':outer': [9, 14]. Outer subjects are allowed if a clause acts as the predicate of another clause.
[Line 1082 Sent vepkar-1663.4 Node 9]: [L3 Morpho goeswith-missing-typo] Since the treebank has morphological features, 'Typo=Yes' must be used with 'goeswith' heads.
[Line 1083 Sent vepkar-1663.4 Node 10]: [L3 Morpho goeswith-lemma] The lemma of a 'goeswith'-connected word must be annotated only at the first part.
[Line 1083 Sent vepkar-1663.4 Node 10]: [L3 Morpho goeswith-upos] The UPOS tag of a 'goeswith'-connected word must be annotated only at the first part; the other parts must be tagged 'X'.
